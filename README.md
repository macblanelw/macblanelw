- 👋 Hi, I’m Lance MacBlane (@macblanelw).
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack development and database admin.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React so I can finish my CS50x class that I've been working on for over two years.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now.
- 📫 How to reach me: praying helps. If I really want to talk to you, I'll take you out of my .gitignore file.
